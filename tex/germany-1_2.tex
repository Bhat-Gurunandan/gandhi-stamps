\begin{minipage}{8cm} \hrule \vspace{12pt} West Germany issued one
  stamp and several First Day Covers on October 2, 1969, three of
  which are displayed here. While the single stamp depicts a smiling
  Mahatma, each of the First Day Covers shows a different profile and
  mood. Two covers depict a framed profile and one is without a
  frame. A special postmark with the same profile as on the stamp is
  exceptionally sharp and clear.
