  \hrule \vspace{12pt} Stamp and First Day Cover issued in Cairo,
  United Arab Republic (a union of Egypt and Syria until Syria
  separated in 1961, but continued to be known as the U.A.R. until
  1971) on September 10, 1969. This is one of the few stamps showing a
  grief-stricken Mahatma with the two emblems of India and the
  U.A.R. The Mahatma's name has been misspelt as ``Ghandi'' both on
  the Cover and the stamp but later corrected on the Postal
  Cancellation Mark seen on the First Day Cover
