\begin{minipage}{5.2cm} \hrule \vspace{12pt} Great Britain, for the
  first time, honoured a foreign national leader with a stamp and two
  First Day Covers designed by a non-British person -- Biman
  Mullick. Lord Mountbatten was the Chairman of the U.K.\ Committee
  for the Gandhi Centenary and led the effort for its creation and
  release. The stamp is on a tri-colour background and many come with
  phosphor bands (commonly printed without these bands). The stamp and
  First Day Covers were issued on August 13, 1969.
